# gif-search

gif-search is part of a project from a course called [Data Fetching in React](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/data-fetching-in-react) by Treehouse. The project uses the Giphy API to create a fun gif app in React.

## Installation

To complete this course, you will need to create a free account with [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api), in order to access their API.

You will also need to install [React](https://reactjs.org/).

```bash
npm install create-react-app
```

You may also find it useful to install [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react). I found the downloaded project files do not recognise the 'let' keyword, but installing this package resolved this issue.

```bash
npm install babel-preset-react
```

I've used the [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) package manager for this project (but you are free to use any package manager that you prefer).

```bash
npm install yarn
```
